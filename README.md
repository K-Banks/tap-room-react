# _Tap Room using React_

#### By: _**Kayl Eubanks**_

## Description

_This app is a clone of a previous project creating a mock tap room website. This is recreating a previous project using JSX and React instead of Angular._

## Setup/Installation Requirement for Developers:

* Clone repository on your local computer from https://github.com/K-Banks/tap-room-react.
* Navigate into project directory in command line.
* Install node package manager if not already installed on local machine.
* Run '$ npm install' to download all needed dependencies.
* Run '$ npm run start' to serve the app on localhost:8080

## Component Tree
![Component Tree](./src/assets/READMEImg/TapRoomComponentTree.jpg)

## Notes
 * Designing a component tree is difficult in React without starting to work through the application
 * How can I change the Header's appearance when navigating to a page that does not exist?
 * How can I change the favicon? React-favicon is unclear on proper implementation.
 * Need to re-use the KegList component and hide/show the purchase button based on the route

## Differences between developing in React vs Angular
  * No services to handle moving information around the app in React
  * Re-using components is simpler and more dynamic in React
  * Programming in React without prior planning is difficult and leads to more problems by comparison
  * Syntax is so much simpler in React

## Known Issues
_No known bugs at this time._
_Please contact author at kayleubanks@gmail.com with any bugs._

## Technologies Used
